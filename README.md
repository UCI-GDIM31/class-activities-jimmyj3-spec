Metaphor: Shopping in a mall. The whole process is like exploring new things within Unity. When I saw some interesting tools, I would try them just like I walk into stores in the mall. But I still follow the direction as the guideline tells. But eventually, I will find out what I need to add on and run the game successfully. Overall, I think our first minigame project is preparing us for future projects, and I like what we are currently doing.
