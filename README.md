Metaphor: Shopping in a mall. The whole process is like exploring new things within Unity. When I saw some interesting tools, I would try them just like I walk into stores in the mall. But I still follow the direction as the guideline tells. But eventually, I will find out what I need to add on and run the game successfully. Overall, I think our first minigame project is preparing us for future projects, and I like what we are currently doing.

### W2
1. Variables r, g, and b are floats because they represent the color of the ball. Strings and booleans cannot be used as color variables. Integers can be used, but it will cause the color of the ball to change too quickly.
2. The _bounce is an integer because the amount of ball bouncing cannot be used as a float, string, or bool.
3. Some of the errors are missing a semicolon, and some of them are missing "f" behind the float.
